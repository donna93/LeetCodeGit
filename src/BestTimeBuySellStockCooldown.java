/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions
 * as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 *
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
